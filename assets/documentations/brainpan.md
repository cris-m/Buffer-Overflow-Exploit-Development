# What brainpan.exe does?

I executed [brainpan.exe](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/blob/main/assets/resources/brainpan.exe) file on windows machine just to undestand what it is doing.

It is not malicious, It is listening for income TCP connection on port ``9999``. From Linux machine, I try to connect to the port. It asked for the password, but I didn't have any password.

I tried any password to connect with ``password`` as the password and I got ``ACCESS DENIED`` message. :flushed: :flushed: :flushed:

Now I went on Windows side to see what was happening and, I saw based on printed message that the TCP server received my connection on port ``9999`` with my password. The password is copied to the buffer.

I needed to find the password. After analyzing the binary in Linux using a tool called ``strings``, I saw a hard-coded string called ``shitstorm``. The string result I got can be found in [brainpan.txt](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/blob/main/assets/resources/brainpan.txt).

I attempted to connect to the TCP server using ``shitstorm`` as password, I got ``ACCESS GRANTED`` message but the connection was terminated.

Again I went on Windows to see what was happening. I realized that all the input I was sending to the TCP server was copied to the buffer.

When I saw that data was copied to the buffer directly, buffer overflow concept come in my mind.
