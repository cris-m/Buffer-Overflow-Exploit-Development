# Brainpan.exe file

I executed [brainpan.exe](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/blob/main/assets/resources/brainpan.exe) file on windows machine just to undestand what it is doing.

It is not malicous, It is listening for income TCP connection on port ``9999``. From linux machine, I try to connect to the port. It asked for the password but I didn't have any password.

I tried any password to connect with ``password`` as the password and I got ``ACCESS DENIED`` message. :flushed:

Now I went on windows side to see what was happening and I saw based on printed message that the TCP server received my connection on port ``9999`` with my password. The password is copied to the buffer.

I needed to find the password. After analysing the binary in linux using a tool called ``strings``, I saw a hardcoded string called ``shitstorm``. The string result I got can be found in [brainpan.txt](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/blob/main/assets/resources/brainpan.txt).

I attempted to connect to the TCP server using ``shitstorm`` as password, I got ``ACCESS GRANDTED`` message but the connection was termined.

Again I went on windows to see what was happening. I realised that all the input I was sending to the TCP server was copied to the buffer.

When I saw that data was copied to the buffer directly buffer overflow concept come in my mind.
