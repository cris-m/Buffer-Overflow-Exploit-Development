# Beginner's Guide to Buffer Overflow Exploit Development

## Introduction

I'm relatively new to the security community, and like many beginners, I dedicate a portion of my time to platforms such as [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com "HackTheBox website") and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com "TryHackMe website"). Recently, I was working on a room called [Brainpan 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/brainpan "Brainpan TryHackMe room"), which I found particularly intriguing as it involves reverse engineering Windows executables and developing buffer overflow exploits.

As the saying goes, ***"The best way to learn is to teach,"*** and so I've put together this documentation for fellow beginners interested in buffer overflow exploit development. Let's have some fun! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

You can locate all the source code used in this documentation within the [resources](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/tree/main/assets/resources "Resource folder") folder, including the Windows executable.
