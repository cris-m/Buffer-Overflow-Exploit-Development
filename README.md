# Buffer Overflow Exploit Development For Beginner

## Introduction

I am beginner in security community and as my fellow beginner, I spend some of my time at platform like [Hackethebox](https://www.hackthebox.com "Hackthebox website") and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com "TryHackMe website"). I was working on a room called [Brainpan](https://tryhackme.com/room/brainpan "Brainpan tryhackme room") which I found interesting since it involves reverse engineering windows executable and exploit it. I will focus on the windows execution reverse engineering and exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability.

As they say, ***"The best way to learn is to teach"***, I wrote this documentation for beginners in buffer overflow exploit development. Let have fun! :smiley: :smiley: :smiley:

All the source code used in this documentation can be found in the [resources](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/tree/main/assets/resources "Resource folder") folder, including the windows executable.
