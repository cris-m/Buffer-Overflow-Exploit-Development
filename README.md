# Buffer Overflow Exploit Development For Beginner

# Introduction
I am beginner in security community and as my fellow beginner, I spend some of my time at platform like [Hackethebox]("https://www.hackthebox.com") and [TryHackMe]("https://tryhackme.com"). I was working a a room called [Brainpan]("https://tryhackme.com/room/brainpan") which I found interresting since it involves reverse engineering windows executable and exploit it. I will focus on the windows execution reverse engineering and exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerabilty.

All the source code used can be found in the [resources](https://github.com/cris-m/buffer_overflow_exploit_development/tree/main/assets/resources) folder including the windows executable.
